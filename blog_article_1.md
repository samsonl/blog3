It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
